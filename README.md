# Ethics

### tl;dr

If we only have your attention for a brief moment, this is what you should leave with: 

We are firmly grounded in our endeavor to not collect data or to know our customers. 

Cypherpunklabs is a for profit endeavor, a company that has a goal of making profit. It is not a statement, 
exercise of rebellion, protest, cleaver discovery of a loophole or socialism. 

Lawyers and accountants are involved and at the end of the day, cypherpunklabs is ran much like any other company
that has to comply with US laws and regulations.  

This all revolves around the commitment we have to those who purchased service(s). Any and all of this is based
on those simple transactions between us and people who, for who knows what reasons, chose to trust us enough to
send a payment.

While we're hoping to find ways to be best possible non-actors in any and all of the communities and/or projects our 
services have an impact on, what ever we do, will always have to be compatible with commitments we have to those that bought 
services. This repo is our attempt at finding ways to spread information, educate and participate in open and positive manner. 

## The longer version

When it comes to the "vending machine", the services we sell, we could split it in two parts.
 
We aim to deliver _exactly_ and _only_ what the customer paid for. This repo deals with the "only" part of this arrangement
with our customers and with the possible implications this might have in some broader context.

Namely we aim to "nerf" our selves to as benign actor as we can be. We don't want to be seen or act as someone who runs or 
controls x number of nodes, because this is not what we are doing. To clarify this a little bit, we don't want to obfuscate the number of
nodes we run or downplay the impact it might have. We aim to discover what those implications are, could be or might become. 
To find best ways to do this responsibly and as a good actor in all of the communities our services have an impact on. 
Goal of this is to discover what we're doing means, what the implications are, how can we be better at it and
what measures we can take to mitigate or prevent issues. 

Because of the way we chose to go about all of this, we have no way of probing what it is the people who made a payment 
would want us to do to best represent their wishes. Because of the _only what they paid for_ part it's clear to us, and should 
be to our customers, that part of that agreement isn't us wielding some power over any community or project or drive changes, champion
for causes, features or direction these projects are heading to. This is why we will never vote for our customers. 
We will not be a representative of people we have no way of engaging with. If we ever have a seat on any of the tables imaginable
we should be there only to provide technical or other types of opinions, but what ever weight these opinion might have, should not
be based on the number of nodes we run for people who aren't us.

It's hard to imagine all the possible implications different levels of success might cause. Some of the threats or undesirable effects are
there no matter how benign we actually are. For example if we run significant number of nodes and the image we run on these 
peers has an issue, poses a threat on the network they're participating in, that impact is amplified by the volume of nodes 
we're running for our customers. If we run signifficant number of nodes in one specific provider and some issue happens, the impact is 
again amplified by the volume of nodes we're running. And many other things we haven't discovered, but would prefer to as soon as we 
possibly can.

## why this matters now

This isn't a problem we're ever going to solve completely. There will always be an edge case we never knew of and we'll have to struggle 
with. We can't fully explain why we feel this is urgent, because some of the conversations we're having and opportunities we've been 
given we can't share yet, because of NDA's and such. We feel the growth we might be seeing on some of the services we are providing is such 
that just based on math, we will be running a signifficant portion of certain types of nodes in TOR network.

This is an open invitation for all people concerned. We hope to motivate all of you to voice concerns. Think of scenarios you don't 
want to see happening. Think of scenarios that might be a concern at specific circumstances. Dig deep, think adverserially. We need
these concerns out there so that we can hopefully find ways to do this in a responsible manner. We hope to atract best possible minds 
we can reach to question us, what we're doing and how we should be doing it.

There are specific concerns we have, for some we have some ideas how to mitigate and approach, and we'll be sharing these as 
fast as we can get them written and digested. This is an incomplete version, but we felt we need to get the ball rolling and 
start the conversations that need to happen so that this can work for all of us.

## Code of conduct

We hope to never have a need for one for this repo. Instead of trying to outline some never before seen version of this, 
we instead opted to explain what it is we're trying to achieve here and trust that enough people see the value in 
what we're trying to achieve and participate in productive and civil manner.

How this is going to work is this:

If this turns into a shitposting fest with more salt than beef, we're ending the experiment and go back to the drawing board.
The goal of this is to engage with the communities our activities have an impact on. We really really hope to find a way for this 
to be a two way process where people from different backgrounds can voice concerns and evaluate what it is we're doing.

This needs to be accessible to academics, lawyers, engineers, shitposters, influencers, random people, people who have 0 intrest in 
witty banter and subtle insults. Because there are real implications to how well this works out. We honestly really hope
to find ways to participate in a sustainable and responsible manner. We need all of the concerns to be out there available 
to everyone who cares to think about these things and provide feedback on.
